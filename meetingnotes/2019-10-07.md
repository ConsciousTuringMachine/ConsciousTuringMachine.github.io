# Today
- Zheng introduced some high-level concepts of LIDA system: Cognitive Cycle includes perception, Memory Retrieval, Conscious Broadcast and Action. 
- We find out that Attentional Codelets is similar to the Up-tree in CTM.  

# Zheng’s resources:
1. LIDA system. It has 30 years research on top of that. So it would be a good reference place. 
2. Other theories or frameworks of AGI: OpenCog, ACT-R, … 
3. State-Of-Art tools that is useful or promising: Graph Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, … 

# Bulut’s resources:
1. Interesting neuroscientific results that agree or disagree with the CTM model. 

# Next
－ Bulut will introduce his research interest and we will talk together.
